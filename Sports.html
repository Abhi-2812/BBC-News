                <p>England's Ashes campaign ended with another crushing defeat by Australia in the final one-day
                    international in Melbourne.
                    The tourists, who had already lost the series, collapsed again to 163 all out before Australia
                    cantered to a eight-wicket victory with 13.4 overs to spare
                    Debutant Emma Lamb was bowled for a second-ball duck and captain Heather Knight was castled by a
                    Tahlia McGrath yorker, leaving England 19-2.
                    Tammy Beaumont and Nat Sciver rebuilt with a partnership of 88 but did so cautiously and when
                    Beaumont fell for 50 from 101 balls England were 107-3 in the 35th over.
                </p>
                <p>Beaumont's wicket sparked a sorry slump as the last eight wickets fell for 56 runs, the innings
                    ending after 49.3 overs.
                    Australia raced to 74-0 in their chase before Alyssa Healy, dropped by wicketkeeper Amy Jones on 24,
                    was caught off a leading edge for a 56-ball 42.
                    Fellow opener Rachael Haynes fell in the next over without progressing the score but captain Meg
                    Lanning with 57 not out and all-rounder Ellyse Perry's unbeaten 31 blunted any hope of an England
                    fightback.
                    The tourists briefly flickered into life during the drawn Test but they have otherwise been
                    outclassed in the series - Australia unbeaten, ending 12-4 winners on the points-based system.
                    England's only points came in the draw and two wash-outs meaning they end the series without a win,
                    the first time that has happened in a multi-format Ashes series.
                    It also means England's women's and men's sides have played 12 matches in Australia this winter and
                    won none.

            <h4 class="heading-4">England captain Heather Knight: </h4>
            <p>
                "The way we started the series with the bat was outstanding. We will be a bit frustrated there were a
                few opportunities missed. The last two games aren't a reflection of us as a side. We were a bit fatigued
                and a bit tired.
                "Bar today our bowling has been in a really good place. We are looking forward to getting to New Zealand
                and starting again."

                "We have had so many contributors. That holds us in good stead moving forwards. Today was a complete
                performance with bat and ball."

            <p>
                "That was the most comprehensive win of them all. England came out and made it look like they were
                batting on a really tricky wicket. They just didn't have enough runs on the board. Australia played
                aggressive cricket, lost two wickets but with the skill of Lanning and Perry were able to rebuild."
