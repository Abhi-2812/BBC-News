                <p>Two people have been arrested amid clashes as protesters surrounded Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.
                    Sir Keir was protected by police and removed by car near Parliament shortly after 17:00 GMT on
                    Monday.
                    Protesters could be heard shouting "traitor" and criticising his record on Covid, and there were
                    some cries of "Jimmy Savile".
                    Some Tory MPs urged Boris Johnson to withdraw his false claim that Sir Keir failed to prosecute
                    Savile.</p>
                <p>Labour has not commented but it is understood Sir Keir, a former director of public prosecutions,
                    returned safely back to his office and was not harmed during the incident.

                    In a tweet, Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the "absolutely disgraceful" behaviour directed
                    at Sir Keir and thanked police for "responding swiftly".

                    "All forms of harassment of our elected representatives are completely unacceptable," Mr Johnson
                    wrote.</p>
                <p>But some Conservative MPs and party figures have urged Mr Johnson to apologise for his Savile comment in the wake of Monday night's incident.
                    Last week, his former head of policy and longstanding aide, Munira Mirza, cited the remark as the reason for her resignation.</p>

    <blockquote>
        After the incident at Westminster, Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted: "This is what happens when fake news is amplified and given credibility by people who should know better.
Sir David Lidington, a former senior Tory MP and Cabinet minister, said he was completely appalled by what he had seen of Monday's incident.
"No politician in the United Kingdom or any other democracy should expect to be treated in that way," he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.
Asked if Mr Johnson was responsible for the incident, Sir David said the prime minister "did not intend his comments in the House of Commons to have the impact we saw tonight, but there is no doubt the mob were reflecting in their abuse the link between Keir Starmer and the decision not to prosecute Jimmy Savile that the prime minister made".
Sir David called on Mr Johnson to "retract and apologise".
"I hope the prime minister will now do that," he added.
Conservative MP Julian Smith tweeted: "What happened to Keir Starmer tonight outside Parliament is appalling. It is really important for our democracy & for his security that the false Savile slurs made against him are withdrawn in full."
Another Conservative MP, Sir Roger Gale, echoed those sentiments and said he feared the "disgraceful treatment" of Sir Keir was "the direct result of the deliberately careless use of language" in the House of Commons.

            <h4 class="heading-4">Analysis By Laura Kuenssberg Political Editor</h4>
            <p>Monday's incident has reignited the anger inside the Conservative Party at the prime minister's false claims in Parliament a week ago.
                His refusal to apologise, and partial retraction, made some MPs queasy and was the trigger for at least one of them to add their private letter to those already submitted in an effort to oust him.                
                It's impossible to say categorically that the protesters had been driven by the prime minister's comments last week.                
                But the ugly event has stirred calls again among Tory MPs for the PM to take back his comments completely, and to acknowledge the danger of what he'd said.
                There is no sign as I write that No 10 has any intention of doing so.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h4 class="heading-4">Ridiculous slur</h4>
            <p>Videos on social media showed Sir Keir being escorted into the police car on the Victoria Embankment, opposite the London Eye.
                Protesters can be heard repeatedly shouting "traitor", while criticising the Labour leader for backing Covid vaccinations and not "opposing the government".
                Some protesters were seen holding signs opposing mandatory vaccinations and restrictions to curb the spread of Covid.
                One person shouted: "Do you enjoy working for the new world order?"
                On one of the videos, someone can be heard shouting: "Jimmy Savile.
                Police later said a man and a woman were arrested after a traffic cone was thrown at officers.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h4 class="heading-4">Who were the protesters?</h4>
            <p>Today's protest in Westminster was an attempt to replicate the "freedom convoy" in Canada's capital in recent days.
                But unlike the protest in Ottawa, the UK rally was small. Familiar faces from anti-vaccine rallies that have been held during the pandemic were in attendance   
                The small gathering outside the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police had been relatively quiet up until Sir Keir was surrounded.   
                Amid shouts of "traitor" and references to Jimmy Savile and paedophiles, the Labour leader was accused by one protester of "ignoring our Magna Carta".   
                This a familiar theme used by followers of the so-called "sovereign citizen" movement.   
                They believe they can opt out of laws - including Covid restrictions - by invoking a clause in Magna Carta - the royal charter of rights signed in 1215.  
                They have handed fake legal documents to health workers and teachers to try to stop Covid vaccinations and some have even tried to remove Covid patients from intensive care wards, citing non-existent "common law" empowering them to do so</p>
