                        registered in 24 hours, taking the death toll to 5,04,062, said the Union health ministry on

                    <p>Beaumont's wicket sparked a sorry slump as the last eight wickets fell for 56 runs, the innings
                        ending after 49.3 overs.
                        Australia raced to 74-0 in their chase before Alyssa Healy, dropped by wicketkeeper Amy Jones on
                        24,
                        was caught off a leading edge for a 56-ball 42.
                        Fellow opener Rachael Haynes fell in the next over without progressing the score but captain Meg
                        Lanning with 57 not out and all-rounder Ellyse Perry's unbeaten 31 blunted any hope of an
                        England
                        fightback.
                        The tourists briefly flickered into life during the drawn Test but they have otherwise been
                        outclassed in the series - Australia unbeaten, ending 12-4 winners on the points-based system.
                        England's only points came in the draw and two wash-outs meaning they end the series without a
                        win,
                        the first time that has happened in a multi-format Ashes series.
                        It also means England's women's and men's sides have played 12 matches in Australia this winter
                        and
                        won none.
