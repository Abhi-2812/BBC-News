                <p>Multiple oil transport and storage companies across Europe are dealing with cyber-attacks.
                    IT systems have been disrupted at Oiltanking in Germany, SEA-Invest in Belgium and Evos in the
                    Netherlands.
                    In total dozens of terminals with oil storage and transport around the world have been affected,
                    with firms reporting that the attacks occurred over the weekend.
                    But experts caution against assuming this is a co-ordinated attack.
                    The BBC understands that all three companies' IT systems went down or were severely disrupted.</p>
                <p>Belgian prosecutors say they are investigating the cyber-attack that's affected SEA-Invest terminals
                    including the company's largest in Antwerp, called SEA-Tank.
                    A spokeswoman for the company said they were hit on Sunday with every port they run in Europe and
                    Africa affected.
                    The company is working to get a back-up IT system online but says that most liquid transportation is
                    operational.
                    The spokeswoman said SEA-Invest is aware of the cyber-attacks against other companies but
                    investigations have not determined if there is a link.
                    A spokesperson for Evos in the Netherlands told the BBC that IT services at terminals in Terneuzen,
                    Ghent and Malta have "caused some delays in execution".</p>

                On Monday Oiltanking Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, which stores and transports oil, vehicle fuels and other
                petroleum products, said it had been hacked.

            <p>The company was forced to operate at a "limited capacity" and was investigating the incident, it said.
                Some reports suggest the attack on Oiltanking is ransomware, where hackers scramble data and make
                computer systems inoperable until they get paid a ransom.</p>
