                <p>The US and Japan have agreed to remove Trump-era tariffs from around 1.25 million metric tonnes a
                    year of Japanese steel imports.
                    Under the deal, Japan says it will help to tackle excess steel supplies, which push down prices.
                    The agreement is aimed to stamp out "unfair practices" in the global steel industry, which is
                    dominated by China.
                    The Biden administration has already made a similar deal with the EU but tariffs remain in place on
                    UK imports
                    The agreement with Japan, which takes effect on 1 April "will further help us rebuild relationships
                    with our allies around the world as we work to fight against China's unfair trade practices," US
                    Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
                    During Donald Trump's presidency Washington imposed tariffs on a number of countries, citing cheap
                    metal imports as a national security threat.
                    Under the new deal, the US will stop charging a 25% levy on Japanese steel imports, excluding
                    aluminium, up to a 1.25m metric tonne annual threshold.
                    Meanwhile, Tokyo said it will take steps within six months to support what the US and Japan see as a
                    fairer steel market.
                    These include taxing goods believed to be priced below market value, and a levy to offset subsidies
                    that an exporter has received.</p>
                <p>The announcement was cautiously welcomed by investment experts.
                    "This lifting of Trump-era tariffs on steel is consistent with expectations that the Biden
                    administration would align its geo-political and trade alliances," Vishnu Varathan, head of
                    economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, told the BBC.
                    "However, the reality is that even the initial tariffs did not impact China too badly. So, this deal
                    may really be more about reparations of relations in a longer trade game," he added.
                    On 1 January, a deal between the Brussels and Washington took effect which allows tariff-free
                    exports of EU steel and aluminium to the US.
                    However, the UK has not yet reached an agreement to lift tariffs imposed on its steel and aluminium
                    exports during the Trump era.
                    Last month, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the issue would be addressed "when the time
                    is right".</p>

            <h4 class="heading-4">Business</h4>
            <p>Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the border taxes on British steel and aluminium exports would be
                addressed "when the time is right"
                British exporters currently pay a 25% duty on steel shipments to the US.
                However their European counterparts are able to export to the US tariff-free after a deal was struck
                last year.

        <div class="card">
            <h4 class="heading-4">Business</h4>
            <p>The US suspended Trump-era tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium levied on European products, but
                left them in place on UK exports.
                One UK steel exporter has already said it is shifting production to Spain as a result. United Cast Bar
                Limited told the BBC it was unlikely to move production back to the UK once it had been moved, unless an
                agreement was reached with the US very quickly.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h4 class="heading-4">Business</h4>
            <p>Ms Tai said it had taken six months to reach an agreement with the EU. Washington has also opened formal
                negotiations with Japan about the ongoing tariffs on its metals.
                "It's a matter of pragmatism," she said, referring to when a deal might be struck with the UK.
                "We just need to have a process that makes sense, but the UK is very much on our minds and I am
                confident that we will take this up when the time is right," she said.</p>
