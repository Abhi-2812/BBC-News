                <p>The discovery of the remains of the Clotilda, 160 years after it sank, brings new life and interest
                    to the settlement built by the original survivors.
                    "It's crazy to think they would have sailed right past here," Darron Patterson said, pulling his car
                    onto a scrap of grass overlooking the murky Mobile River. As president of the Clotilda Descendants
                    Association, Patterson is well versed in talking about the voyage of the Clotilda – the last known
                    slave ship to reach America. His great-great-grandfather was Kupollee, later renamed Pollee Allen;
                    one of the 110 men, women and children cruelly stolen from Benin in West Africa and brought to the
                    US onboard the notorious ship.</p>
                <p>The story of how Patterson's relative arrived in America aboard an illegal slaver started as a
                    shockingly flippant bet. Fifty-two years after the US banned the importation of enslaved people, in
                    1860, a wealthy Alabama business owner named Timothy Meaher wagered that he could orchestrate for a
                    haul of kidnapped Africans to sail under the noses of federal officers and evade capture.
                    With the assistance of Captain William Foster at the helm of an 80ft, two-mast schooner, and
                    following a gruelling six-week transatlantic passage, he succeeded. The ship sneaked into Mobile Bay
                    on 9 July under a veil of darkness. To conceal evidence of the crime, the distinctive-looking
                    schooner – made from white oak frames and southern yellow pine planking – was set ablaze and
                    scuttled to the depths of the swampy Mobile River, where it lay concealed beneath the water, its
                    existence relegated to lore.</p>

                Walking back to his car, Patterson, a former sportswriter now in his 60s, recalled that growing up,
                Africatown was a thriving, self-sufficient place, where "the only time we needed to leave the community
                was to pay a utility bill" as everything needed was close to hand, aside from a post office.

            <h4 class="heading-4">Travel</h4>
            <p>Located three miles north of downtown Mobile, Africatown was founded by 32 of the original Clotilda
                survivors following emancipation at the end of the Civil War, in 1865. Longing for the homeland they'd
                been brutally ripped from, the residents set up their own close-knit community to blend their African
                traditions with American folkways, raising cattle and farming the land. One of the first towns
                established and controlled by African Americans in the US, Africatown had its own churches, barbershops,
                stores (one of which was owned by Patterson's uncle); and the Mobile County Training School, a public
                school that became the backbone of the community</p>

            <h4 class="heading-4">Travel</h4>
            <p>However, this once-vibrant neighbourhood fell on hard times when a freeway was constructed in the heart
                of it in 1991, and industrial pollution meant that many of the remaining residents eventually packed up
                and left. "We couldn't even hang out our washing to dry because it would get covered in ash [a product
                of the oil storage tanks and factories on the outskirts of Africatown]," said Patterson. With the
                high-profile closure of the corrugated box factory, International Paper, in 2000, and an ensuing public
                health lawsuit brought about by residents, Africatown's community that had swelled to 12,000 people in
                the 1960s plummeted to around 2,000, where it stands today.</p>
